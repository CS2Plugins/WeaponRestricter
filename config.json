{
  // Example: "weapon_awp": 2
  // "weapon_awp" is the weapon name, optionally a friendlier name such as "AWP" can also be used.
  // 2 is the number of players (i.e for every 2 players allow 1 weapon)
  // So, if 4 players are in the server, 2 awps per team will be allowed.
  // Why this way? cause JON is a cunt.
